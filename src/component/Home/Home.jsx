                    Lohardaga Rug Unit - Empowering Tribal Women through Craftsmanship
Weaving Dreams, Transforming Lives

Introducing the Lohardaga Rug Unit, a shining illustration of the potent combination of community backing and masterful craftsmanship. Situated at the heart of Lohardaga, our establishment is dedicated to uplifting local indigenous women who were once engaged in crafting items from palm leaves. Overcoming challenges posed by the unique environment—a bauxite area nestled within a dense forest—where traditional transportation is not feasible, we embarked on a mission to elevate their skills and broaden their horizons. Despite the hurdles, our commitment prevailed, and we successfully achieved our goal, turning adversity into an opportunity for growth and empowerment
